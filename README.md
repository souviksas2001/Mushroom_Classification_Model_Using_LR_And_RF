# Mushroom_Classification_Model_Using_LR_And_RF
Building a mushroom classification model involves creating a machine learning or deep learning model that can accurately classify mushrooms into different categories based on their characteristics. The primary goal is typically to distinguish between edible and poisonous mushrooms. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a basic mushroom classification model:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather a dataset of mushroom images or characteristics. You can find mushroom datasets online or create your own by collecting images and information about different mushrooms.
   - Ensure that your dataset includes labels indicating whether each mushroom is edible or poisonous.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the data. This may involve resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and encoding categorical features such as mushroom cap color, odor, etc., into numerical format (one-hot encoding or label encoding).
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. A common split is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.

3. **Feature Extraction (if using images)**:
   - If you are working with image data, you can use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically learn relevant features from the images. Common pre-trained CNN architectures like VGG, ResNet, or Inception can be used for feature extraction.

4. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose a machine learning or deep learning model architecture. For image classification, deep learning models like CNNs are popular choices due to their ability to learn complex patterns.

5. **Model Design and Training**:
   - Design your classification model. This typically includes defining the model architecture, adding layers (e.g., convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers), and specifying activation functions.
   - Compile the model by selecting an appropriate loss function (e.g., binary cross-entropy for binary classification), optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD), and evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy).
   - Train the model on your training dataset using the fit() method. Monitor the training process and adjust hyperparameters as needed to avoid overfitting (e.g., by using dropout and regularization techniques).

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate your model on the validation set to assess its performance. Common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
   - Fine-tune your model based on validation results if necessary.

7. **Testing**:
   - Finally, assess the model's performance on the test set to obtain an unbiased estimate of its generalization capabilities.

8. **Deployment**:
   - If the model performs well, you can deploy it in a real-world application. This could be a web application, mobile app, or any other system where you want to classify mushrooms.

9. **Maintenance**:
   - Continue to monitor the model's performance in the real world and retrain it periodically with new data to keep it up to date.

It's important to note that when dealing with mushrooms, especially for classification purposes, safety is paramount. Ensure that you have expert-verified data on which mushrooms are edible and which are poisonous. Misclassifying a poisonous mushroom as edible could have serious consequences.
